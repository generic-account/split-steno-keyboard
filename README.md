# Split Steno Keyboard

This repo has some of the files from a custom split keyboard I made a few years ago.

The keyboard is designed to be maximally ergonomic for my hand shape (col height and thumb cluster positioning), have NKRO support for stenography with Plover, to have enough keys for a full QWERTY layout, and to be relatively simple and cheap to manufacture.

Unfortunately I have lost some files, so this repository is incomplete.

## Features:
- Low profile Kailh Choc switches
- RPI Pico-based
- Split halves connected by 3.5mm headphone cable
- NKRO for steno support
